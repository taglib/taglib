### TagLib Audio Metadata Library

http://taglib.org/

TagLib is a library for reading and editing the metadata of several
popular audio formats. Currently it supports both ID3v1 and [ID3v2][]
for MP3 files, [Ogg Vorbis][] comments and ID3 tags 
in [FLAC][], MPC, Speex, WavPack, TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4, APE,
DSF, DFF, and ASF files.

TagLib is distributed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License][]
(LGPL) and [Mozilla Public License][] (MPL). Essentially that means that
it may be used in proprietary applications, but if changes are made to
TagLib they must be contributed back to the project. Please review the
licenses if you are considering using TagLib in your project.
